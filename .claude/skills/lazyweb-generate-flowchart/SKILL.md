# Lazyweb — Generate Flow Chart

Produce the **canonical flow chart** for a product and save it, so proposals
(`/lazyweb-propose-ui-changes`) can be made *against a stable chart*. The output
uses the same **sectioned** shape the Lazyweb metrics tab uses, so any product's
chart lands looking like ours — without hardcoding Lazyweb's content.

Saved via the Lazyweb MCP: `lazyweb_save_flowchart({ product, diagram })` →
returns `{ flowchart_id, flowchart_url }`. Re-running for the same `product`
UPDATES that one chart in place (stable id + URL); it is not duplicated.

## Matter of fact — never for explaining

The canonical chart is the **system of record**: a matter-of-fact map of the
product's **current state**, derived from the real code, shown on the user's
Architecture dashboard. It is NOT a communication device.

- **Never** use this skill (or `lazyweb_save_flowchart`) to explain a concept,
  answer a question, trace a failure, teach, or illustrate a hypothetical. A
  diagram shaped around a question is an *explanation*, and saving it here
  **overwrites the one canonical chart** (same product upserts in place) or
  hijacks the user's dashboard (latest chart wins).
- Explanations go through **`/lazyweb-explain-flow`** (`lazyweb_explain_flow`) —
  separate insert-only storage at `/explainer/<id>/`; it cannot collide with the
  canonical chart. You may copy the canonical chart as a starting point there.
- Litmus test: *would this diagram be identical no matter what question the user
  just asked?* If no, it's an explanation — wrong skill.
- Content here states what IS: real sections, real payloads, real timings. No
  emphasis added for a narrative, no "what went wrong" sections, no hypotheticals.

## MCP Setup

Use the hosted Lazyweb MCP tools at `https://www.lazyweb.com/mcp`.

Required tools:
- `lazyweb_health` — verify connectivity when the MCP surface is uncertain
- `lazyweb_save_flowchart` — persist the finished chart (returns `flowchart_id` + `flowchart_url`)
- `lazyweb_get_flowchart` — fetch a saved chart back (by `flowchart_id` or `product`)

If Lazyweb MCP is missing — or `lazyweb_save_flowchart` isn't in the tool list —
tell the user to run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.lazyweb.com/install.sh | bash
```

Then reload the client and rerun the skill.

## The model (the convention that makes charts consistent)
A product ⇄ backend story breaks into **sections**, stacked top→bottom — one per
capability ("skill").

- **Initialization is optional.** Include a first section for a one-time
  connect/handshake (auth, capabilities, tool list, session) *only if the product
  actually has one*. MCP servers and stateful/session APIs do; a stateless
  REST/GraphQL backend usually doesn't — start at the first real skill instead of
  inventing a handshake.

- **Each skill is sync or async.** Pick the shape that matches how THIS product
  really behaves — don't force everything into the poll+pipeline mold:
  - **Synchronous** — one round trip (request → response). A short left→right spine.
  - **Async · poll** — request → **job/ticket id**, caller **polls** in a loop, a
    **background pipeline** (a band of steps) runs until the result is ready.
    (Spine + pipeline band + `branch`/`return`.)
  - **Async · stream / SSE / websocket** — request opens a channel and the server
    **pushes** events/chunks over time. Model the open + a `loop:true` "receives
    events" step. No ticket, no poll.
  - **Async · webhook / callback** — request returns an immediate ack; the backend
    **calls back** later at a registered URL. Model the ack + a `return` edge from
    the backend to a "callback received" step. No poll loop.
  - **Async · fire-and-forget / queue** — request enqueues work and returns;
    nothing comes back to the caller (or it's read elsewhere). A `branch` into a
    pipeline band with **no** `return`.

Use the PRODUCT'S real actors, skills, and async shape — this taxonomy is a menu to
choose from, not a mold to force everything into.

## Make it useful (this is what separates a good chart from a shape)
Written for a PM who thinks in systems but not syntax — so:
- **EVERY node and EVERY edge gets `data`.** Not just "transform" steps — a user taps
  ANY box or arrow expecting a real content snippet. Every message gets
  `data: { request, response }`; every step gets `data: { input, output }` (whichever
  of the two actually exists — a step that only receives shows `input`, one that only
  emits shows `output`). Pull the **actual** shapes from the codebase (grep the
  handlers) — never invent generic payloads. If genuinely NO content crosses an
  element, say so explicitly in its `note` (e.g. "fire-and-forget signal; no payload").
- **Completeness gate before you're done:** `lazyweb_save_flowchart` returns
  `data_coverage` naming every node/edge without `data` (+ a `data_hint`). Treat a
  non-empty list as a TO-DO: backfill the real payloads from the code and re-save
  (same product → updates in place). Don't stop while elements users will tap are hollow.
- **Keep values real and complete — do NOT collapse a field to an ellipsis.** Storing
  `"instructions": "# Welcome to Lazyweb …"` throws the content away: there is nothing
  left to read. The viewer already **clamps long blocks to ~10 lines with a "Show more"
  toggle**, so paste the *actual* value (trim a genuinely enormous blob to a
  representative slice, but never lop it to `…`). The only legitimate use of `…` is to
  **redact a secret** (e.g. `"Authorization": "Bearer 3f9c…"`), never to shorten real content.
- **Slicing a long ARRAY keeps full-shape items.** When a list is too long to store
  whole (30 tools, 100 results), keep the first item(s) with **every real field
  intact** — the slice must show the true shape of one element — and state in the
  element's `note` how many entries were omitted (e.g. "response carries 31 tools;
  first shown in full, rest elided"). Never strip kept items down to one field (a
  name-only tool list misrepresents the payload as bare names when the real entries
  carry `description` + `inputSchema` too) and never insert a bare `"…"` as an
  array entry: truncation is *stated* in the `note`, not faked in-band.
- **`bidirectional: true`** on any true request→response message (→ double-headed
  arrow). Leave one-way signals single.
- **`note` on every node/edge** — specific and grounded: what it does, **why it works
  this way** (the *real* tradeoff for THIS product — why async, why a cache, why a
  queue — grounded in the actual code, not a reason borrowed from another product),
  failure behavior, and rough **latency/cost**. Plain English; explain any jargon.
  Never "a step in the flow".
- **Keep on-card `sub` short** (a couple words or a timing). The detail goes in
  `note` (shown when the box is tapped) — long subs get truncated on the card.
- **Plain-English `label`s**; the real method/endpoint name lives in `data`/`note`.

### Layout rules (so it renders like ours — don't hand-place pixels)
- **Sections stack** top→bottom in `sections[]` order; put Initialization first *if
  the product has one* (skip it entirely for stateless APIs).
- Within a section, **spine** steps read left→right by `col` (0,1,2,…); alternate
  actors (caller, server, caller, …) — the accent color comes from `actor`.
- **Async · poll:** add a **poll** step with `loop:true`, a **pipeline band**
  (`row:1`, `bcol` in order), a `branch` edge from the ticket step into the band
  (`to` the first pipeline step or `"builder"`), and a `return` edge from the band
  (`from` the last pipeline step or `"builder"`) to the deliver step. Set the
  section's `builderLabel`. *(Branch/return auto-snap to the band's border.)*
- **Other async shapes:** *stream* → one `loop:true` "receives events" step, no band,
  no ticket; *webhook* → a `return` edge from the backend to a "callback received"
  step, no poll loop; *queue* → a `branch` into a band with **no** `return`.
- **Two-lane messages**: two edges between the same two nodes → give them `lane:-1`
  and `lane:1` so they stack.
- Keep labels short (they wrap to 2 lines). Keep 2–4 actors.

## Steps
1. **Learn the product from the real code.** Read the handlers/docs (or ask 1–2
   questions) to identify: the real actors/tiers, **whether there's an
   initialization/handshake at all**, each skill and its **real shape** (sync, or
   which async kind — poll / stream / webhook / queue), and — importantly — the
   **actual request/response and input/output shapes** each step passes. `grep` the
   endpoint/tool handlers for the payloads.
2. **Build the diagram** in the schema above — one section per skill (plus init only
   if it exists), with a `note` and real `data` on each step/message and
   `bidirectional` on true round trips (see "Make it useful"). Don't overfit to
   Lazyweb; use the product's real names, real payloads, and its real async shape.
   Same *structure* as our chart, not the same words.
3. **Save it:** `lazyweb_save_flowchart({ product, diagram })`. Share the returned
   `flowchart_url` so the user can view it, and keep the `flowchart_id`.
4. **Hand off:** proposals are made against this chart — see
   `/lazyweb-propose-ui-changes`, which takes the `flowchart_id`.

## Notes
- Regenerate/save again when the product's real flow changes; proposals pin to a
  chart version so stale ones can be re-anchored.
- One flow chart per product is the norm; keep node `id`s stable across versions.
